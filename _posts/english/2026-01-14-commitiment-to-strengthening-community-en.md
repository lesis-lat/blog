In 2026, LESIS will take another concrete step in its commitment to the sustainable development of the technology and information security ecosystem in Brazil. We will make a financial donation of BRL 10,000 to the NGO [Mente Binária](https://mentebinaria.com.br/), an organization that works directly on training new professionals for the cybersecurity field.

We believe that information security is not built solely with technology, but with well-prepared people, access to knowledge, and real opportunities for professional growth. This is where Mente Binária’s work becomes essential: by investing in accessible, high-quality technical education, the organization helps transform individual trajectories, impacting families, communities, and ultimately the country itself.

Training new professionals in security strengthens the entire value chain — it helps reduce the talent gap in the market, raises the technical standard of the industry, and contributes to a safer, more resilient digital environment prepared for current and future challenges. Each trained professional represents not just a new career, but a collective advance for the information security sector as a whole.

Our financial contribution is, in itself, a single action. However, it carries a broader conviction: when the right resources reach the right people, impact multiplies. Small actions, when taken consistently and aligned with a clear purpose, build lasting change.

As an institution, LESIS understands that its role goes beyond commercial activity. We have a responsibility to contribute positively to the ecosystem in which we operate, supporting initiatives that generate social, technical, and human value.
We will continue to seek ways to support projects that believe in education as a driver of transformation. Because even when each individual action seems small, it is through these steps that great impact is built.
