The year 2025 has been a milestone for LESIS. Between projects, research, and the growth of our presence in the market, we have also taken on a commitment we consider essential: **to directly contribute to and with the Information Security community**. We believe that innovation is born from people connecting, from the continuous exchange of knowledge, and from the collective construction of solutions that make the digital world safer. That’s why supporting events across the country has become a priority and a concrete way to help the industry evolve.

Throughout this year, we have financially sponsored and participated in initiatives such as [Hacking na Web Day RJ](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lesis-lat_ever-thought-about-spending-a-full-day-diving-activity-7361743511337017344-qYrN/), in Rio de Janeiro; [XibéSec](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lesis-lat_xibésec-is-back-for-its-third-edition-bringing-activity-7364280260671987714-nAGf/), in Belém; [RioCyberSec](https://www.instagram.com/lesis.lat/p/DRMt3HTkaKl/), also in Rio; FortalSec, in [Fortaleza](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lesis-lat_during-the-month-of-february-two-researchers-activity-7299858979961118720-jJwY/); and [Hack in Cariri](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lesis-lat_hackincariri-ciberseguranaexa-tecnologia-activity-7287745352982519809-fVA2/), in Juazeiro do Norte. Each of these events has its own identity and audience: some with a strong academic focus, others more industry-driven, some already consolidated and large-scale, and others still expanding. For us, this diversity is precisely what makes the community so rich — and supporting different profiles is a way to ensure that knowledge reaches farther and farther. Beyond sponsoring, we also made sure to be present as participants in major events such as [SBSEG](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lesis-lat_lesis-is-proud-to-join-the-25th-edition-of-activity-7359220025188139008-KKYG/), [Web Summit](), and [BSides RJ](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/htrgouvea_bsidesrj-foi-incr%C3%ADvel-obrigado-p-quem-separou-activity-7309547965197565952-R3Q7). 

These are spaces where the most relevant cybersecurity discussions thrive, new connections emerge, and strategic partnerships are built. Being close to those conversations is essential both for LESIS’ growth and for our ability to effectively contribute to advancements in the field. 

Naturally, as a company, part of this investment returns in the form of brand positioning, networking, and business opportunities. However, that is not what drives us. Our main motivation is to give back to the community everything it represents to us: shared knowledge, constant inspiration, and the development of professionals who are building a safer future for everyone. We want to take part in the foundation that sustains this ecosystem, fostering new talent and strengthening initiatives that make a difference for those entering the field and for those who have already walked a long journey.

We also make a point of spreading our support across different regions of Brazil. While some hubs, like São Paulo, already benefit from high investment volumes and frequent events, other areas still face limited initiatives and opportunities. Supporting gatherings in the North and Northeast, for example, is a way to help create a more balanced landscape, where talent is not restricted by geography.

This movement is just beginning. We remain open to collaborating with those who share the same vision: a strong, diverse, accessible, and constantly evolving community. 

If you organize an event and believe in the impact of education, knowledge exchange, and the development of information security, we want to help build this future by your side.
